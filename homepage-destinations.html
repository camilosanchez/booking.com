      <h3>The problem</h3>

        <p>When buying a hotel there's always that feeling of uncertainty on the back of people's minds. They're asking themselves: Is this the right hotel for the kind of experience I want to have?</p>
        <p>That's why when they don't know something about a place or a hotel, they ask to their relatives and friends. And go to places like tripadvisor to see what others think about that.</p>
        <p>How can we help to reduce that fear, increasing confidence and improving conversions?</p>

      <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>Bookings can increase if we can help consumers make the right decision leveraging the power of our social proof data.</p>

      <h3>Proposal</h3>
      <p><strong>Booking.com current state </strong> On the homepage, in the featured destinations section, we currently only present the name of the destination and a flag.</p>
      <a href="public/images/homepage-destinations-0.jpg" data-lightbox="booking-image" data-title="Booking.com current state On the homepage, in the featured destinations section, we currently only present the name of the destination and a flag"><img src="public/images/homepage-destinations-0.jpg" alt=""></a>
      <p>I propose to include reviews of those places from our database of 113 million of reviews</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hypothesis:</strong>  Bookings can increase if we present social proof data on the destinations boxes.</li>
        <li><strong>Metric:</strong> Percentage of clicks to the results page.</li>
        <li><strong>Test:</strong> A/B testing on the website.</li>

      <h3>What's next?</h3>

      <p><strong>If the hypothesis is validated</strong>, Continue "milking the cows", go to next item and improve another part of the website.</p>
      <p><strong>If the hypothesis is not validated</strong>, iterate or pivot. Reshape ideas. Try adding <code>text-decoration:underline</code> to the review title</p>
      <p><strong>If the results of test are uncertain</strong>, iterate. Reshape ideas</p>
