    <h2>Improve consumption of photos and reviews</h2>

    <section>
    <h3>User profile</h3>
    <p>Leisure and business customers. Couples, Families with children, groups (all users) .</p>

    <h3>The problem</h3>

    <p>
      When I’m considering a hotel, first thing I do is to see the property’s photos and read reviews of other people that has stayed there. But I really want to clearly see the photos. Reviews are super valuable, but I want to clearly see the photos. These reviews on top are interfering the view of the photos.
    </p>


    <h3>The job the product is hired for</h3>
    <p>Help us choose a hotel by looking at photos to decide if this is the place we want to stay, and let me know what other people say about this place to alleviate the anxiety of not knowing if this place is ok.</p>

    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>

    <p>
<strong>I believe that</strong> [ by changing the placement of the user reviews to the left column right next to the photos component ] <strong>for</strong> [ all users ] <br>
<strong>because</strong> [ of the need people has to clearly see the photos and read the reviews ]. <br>
<strong>will lead to</strong> [ users consuming both types of contents: photos and reviews easily ].<br>
<strong>I’ll now I was sucessful if</strong> [ there is an increase of bookings (quantitative data) and there’s a positive change in user satisfaction from using that feature (qualitative data, behavior)].<br>
<strong>This will be good for customers, partners and our business because</strong> [ people will better appreciate the photos and better read the reviews as we compartmentalised its consumption ].<br>

    <h3>What's next?</h3>

    <p><strong>If the hypothesis is validated</strong>, keep milking the cows.</p>
    <p><strong>If the hypothesis is not validated</strong>, iterate or pivot. Implement qualitative tests to investigate why people is not satisfied with this arrangement of content.</p>
    <p><strong>If the results of test are uncertain</strong>, Gather insights, observe customers and iterate. Reshape Ideas.</p>
