    <h2>Improve visibility of properties in map view</h2>

    <section>
    <h3>User profile</h3>
    <p>Leisure and business customers. Couples, Families with children, groups (all users).</p>

    <h3>The problem</h3>

    <p>
      When using the view map, I can’t easily tell the difference between available and sold out properties because I didn’t notice the subtle difference between pins with transparent and red circles. At first I didn’t know what those colors meant until I clicked on one red and then another transparent. In addition, I’m only interested in properties available and want to easily filter them without having to reload the map.
    </p>
    <p>These people are still in the discovery part of their travel planning process.</p>

    <h3>The job the product is hired for</h3>
    <p>I want to see where are the available properties in the map.</p>

    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>

    <p>
<strong>I believe that</strong> [ by adding a legend that serves both as <strong>1.</strong> labels that describes what the color of the pins mean and <strong>2.</strong> as filters that allow users to hide sold out hotels ] <strong>for</strong> [ all users ] <br>
<strong>because</strong> [ that will make the map more legible and easy to use ] <br>
<strong>will lead to</strong> [ Users finding their properties faster in the map view ].<br>
<strong>I’ll now I was sucessful if</strong> [ there is an increase of bookings from people using that feature (quantitative data) ].<br>
<strong>This will be good for customers, partners and our business because</strong> [ people will find what they are looking for with less clicks ].<br>

    <h3>What's next?</h3>

    <p><strong>If the hypothesis is validated</strong>, keep milking the cows.</p>
    <p><strong>If the hypothesis is not validated</strong>, iterate or pivot, try implementing a shape or color for the pin that helps with differentiation.</p>
    <p><strong>If the results of test are uncertain</strong>, Gather insights, observe customers and iterate. Reshape Ideas.</p>
